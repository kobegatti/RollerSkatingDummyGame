# Program 4 - 11/15/2021 Kobe Gatti

# Roller rink in space with nature
# Lighting: one spot light, geometry has shading
# Skybox implemented: space theme
# Textures: rock, wood floor, a few purple lotuses, can you find them?
# Also simple materials like jade and ruby
# Roller skates are split into two separate obj - shoutout Blender
# Dummy and ramps placed
# WASD plus camera
# Light moves slightly with camera
# G key only works once. After first press, returns camera to end point 
# of spline path

# Next steps for final project:
# Hierarchical model for dummy with skates and get movement going
# Add more ramps and add collision detection
# More spot lights
# When basic movement implemented, add tricks
# Particle physics?
